# UX Design References

This folder contains UI/UX inspiration and design references for the sponge tracking app.

## Design Inspiration

### Oura App Style
The app will take inspiration from the Oura sleep tracking app's design aesthetic:
- **Circular score visualization** with percentage/numeric display
- **Clean, minimal dark theme** with teal/blue accents
- **Card-based layout** for different data sections
- **Bottom navigation** with clear iconography
- **Data visualization** using graphs and charts

## Reference Images

Please save the Oura app screenshots here with descriptive names:
- `oura-sleep-score.png` - Sleep score screen with circular visualization
- `oura-readiness-score.png` - Readiness score screen
- (Add more reference images as needed)

## Application to Sponge App

The sponge tracking app will adapt this design pattern:
- **Circular "Sponge Health Score"** replacing sleep/readiness score
- **Similar color coding**: Green (safe) → Yellow (caution) → Red (replace needed)
- **Stats display**: Usage count, days active, average uses per day
- **Graph visualization**: Usage patterns over time
- **Dark theme** with sponge-appropriate color scheme
